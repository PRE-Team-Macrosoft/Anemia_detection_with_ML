# Anemia detection with machine learing
Research project inspired by "[A deep learning algorithm to detect anaemia with ECGs: a retrospective, multicentre study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30108-4/fulltext)" trying to compare the effectiveness of different machine learning aproaches at detecting anemia.
